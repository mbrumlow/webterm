# Simple web terminal in dart backed by a go service. 

I was poking around my old computer and found this unfinished project and thought I would post it to github for safe keeping. 

The main motivation for writing this was to give dart and go a shot, go stuck, dart did not :(

Before posting it I upgraded the dart project to work with WebStorm as when I originally wrote this dart was pre 1.0 and the IDE of choice was eclipse. 

Its not a very good or fully working terminal implementation.
